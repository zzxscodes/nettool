# Example rules for xdpforward with explicit priorities
# Format: <saddr_v6> <daddr_v6> <sport> <dport> <protocol> <priority> <action>
# Use "*" for wildcards, "tcp" or "udp" for protocol, and "0" (drop) or "1" (forward) for action.

# High-priority rule to drop all traffic from 2001:db8::1 to 2001:db8::2 on TCP port 80
2001:db8::1 2001:db8::2 80 80 tcp 10 0

# Medium-priority rule to forward all UDP traffic from any source to 2001:db8::3 on port 53
* 2001:db8::3 * 53 udp 5 1

# Low-priority rule to drop all traffic from any source to any destination
